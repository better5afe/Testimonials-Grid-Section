### The challenge

This testimonials section is based on a grid layout. While the data is being fetched from Firebase, the user will see a loading spinner (to make this feature more prominent, the fetching function is embedded inside a setTimeout() function - I would not do it if it was a professional project). If the data is successfully loaded, the user will be able to see different animations and layout depending on their device's screen size. If the data fails to be loaded, the users will receive a simple error message.
